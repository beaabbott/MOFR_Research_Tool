# MOFR_Research_Tool
prototype of a research tool I am building to help visually analyze data

# DESCRIPTION 

This is a research tool i'm working to build to look at better analyze a dataset related to my MA research. the lines correspond to journeys of people from Turkey to Greece in late 2015 and early 2016 who were digitally assisted by a Facebook migrant-activist organization. This organization carefully archived the departure and arrival point of each trip they helped to reach safety.

I have been working to make this data into a workable dataset but it still needs some work. I wanted to build this tool so I can understand how and where the assisted trips unfold over time.

Idea is that eventually, when you click on a trip, the information about that trip will poplulate in this side bar (haven't gotten that far). I hope building this up with different functionalities that will help me to analyze the dataset.
